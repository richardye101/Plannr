Plannr is an android app meant for students attending the University of Toronto Scarborough Campus.

Plannr helps students plan their timetables by telling them which courses they can take, 
based on courses they have taken, and when those courses are available.

## Accounts
1. Student accounts have access to a timetable planner. They can save what courses they have taken on their account,
and the planner will tell them which courses they are eligible for, and what term the courses will be offered.

2. Admin accounts can edit the pre-requisites for a course, and what terms they will be offered in.
